1. input for functinos: substring and regexp_replace are both fit for string type input.

2. if one column is an array, we want to expand it to multile rows. we use:
select id, resultsEntitie
from HelpCenterSearchResultsViewEvent 
lateral view explode(resultsEntities) exploded_resultsEntities as resultsEntitie
where size(resultsEntities) > 0 and datepartition='2018-01-01-00'
;

3. when compare with two strings, if one is not string we could cast it to string:
cast(helpCenterEventHeader.currentPageTrackingId as string)
